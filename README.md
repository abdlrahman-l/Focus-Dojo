## 📖 Philosophy

In an era defined by "TikTok Brain" and endless notifications, our ability to perform Deep Work is eroding. **Focus Dojo** is not designed to entertain you. It is designed to retrain your brain using an **Anti-Dopamine** approach:

- **OLED Black UI:** No bright colors or cheap gamification triggers.
- **High Friction:** The "Hold to Read" mechanic forces conscious interaction.
- **Zero Distraction:** Single-tasking only. Tunnel vision enabled.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. 👁️ Focus Reader (Tunnel Vision)

A reading mode that acts like "blinders" for your brain.

- **Single Paragraph Display:** Only shows one block of text at a time.
- **Hold Interaction:** You must physically **hold the screen** to keep the text visible/focused.
- **Benefits:** Prevents skimming and trains visual patience.

### 2. ⌨️ Zen Type (Precision Drill)

Retype philosophical quotes or coding snippets with zero room for error.

- **Backspace Disabled:** You cannot delete mistakes. One typo means restarting the entire sentence.
- **Benefits:** Trains precision, mindfulness, and calm under pressure.

### 3. 🎙️ Vocal Gym (Articulation)

Speech drills to improve clarity and enunciation.

- **Tech:** Powered by the **Web Speech API**.
- **Features:** Automatic language accent detection (ID/EN) based on user preference.
